# util/util.js 
 
1. util functions are not actually util functions.
2. Even no test for util functions. Write tests before writing functions.
3. Poor functions name like ---
    * getCount * 
4. Long if condition -- you can pull it out in a function.

# handleInput.js

1. Unnecessary Noise
    line : 9

# handleInputTest.js

1. No variable declaration anywhere inside it block.
2. Tests are very few not covering every case.
